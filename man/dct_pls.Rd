\title{Discrete Cosine Transform with Penalized Least Squares}
\usage{
dct_pls(x, s = NULL, robust = FALSE, tol = 1e-06, max_iter = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector with potential missing values (`NA`). Represents the input time series to be smoothed or gap-filled.}

\item{s}{A non-negative numeric scalar specifying the smoothing parameter. Smaller values yield less smoothing. If `NULL`, the function uses generalized cross-validation (GCV) to select an optimal value. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{robust}{Logical indicating whether to apply robust reweighting to down-weight outliers. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance for robust iteration. Currently not used but reserved for future enhancements. Default is `1e-6`.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations for robust reweighting. Default is `10`.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `x`, with missing values filled and optionally smoothed.
}

\examples{
# Generate synthetic time series with missing values
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
x <- sin(2 * pi * (1:n) / 20) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.3)
x[30:40] <- NA  # introduce missing values

# Apply DCT-PLS with fixed smoothing
y_filled <- dct_pls(x, s = 1e-6)

# Plot original and filled series
plot(x, type = "l", lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = "black", ylab = "Value", main = "DCT-PLS Example")
lines(y_filled, col = "blue", lwd = 1)
legend("topright", legend = c("Original", "DCT-PLS"), col = c("black", "blue"),
       lty = c(2, 1), lwd = c(1, 2))
